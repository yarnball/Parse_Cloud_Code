# Parse_Cloud_Code

This is a handy file to convery your image URLs to actual files which Parse.com serves itself.

To get this going, you'll simple need to:
1. Define your class
2. Define collumn you want to take the URL from
3. Define the collumn you want to place the new file (make sure the collumn is set to "file" not string/number etc).
